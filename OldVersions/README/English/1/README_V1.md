C is the most widely used programming language, and has been since the 1970s. It runs on every single type of digital device. It is harder to name a device that doesn't utilize C, than it is to name one that uses C.

C was created by Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie in the 1970s at Bell Labs. Dennis Ritchie is probably the most underrated computer scientist of all time. It is said that if you had a magnifying glass/microscope that could look inside of a computer, you would see his influence everywhere.

It is more now, but it is not even close to as many devices that have C support.
